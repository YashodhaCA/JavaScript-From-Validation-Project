# JavaScript-From-Validation-Project
This project demonstrates form validation using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The validation ensures that the data entered by the user is correct and secure before submission.  The form includes fields such as Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password, and validates them based on defined rules.
